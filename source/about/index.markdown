<img class="left half" src="/images/profile.jpg" width="150" height="150" title="Ninja Attack!" style="float: left; margin-right: 12px;" alt=""\>

I'm Ankit. I am a graduate student in the [Computer Science Department at University of Texas at Austin](http://cs.utexas.edu). I like to mess around with new technologies.  My interests are in automation, systems and web apps. I like to create
things.

I like to play soccer, listen to music, play [Age of
Empires](http://store.steampowered.com/app/239550/); you know normal stuff. I watch way too
much TV and like to read about new technologies.
